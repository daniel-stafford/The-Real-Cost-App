<p>Ever wonder how much something really costs? The Real Cost App is here to help. Say you buy a gym membership for the year - how much it is costing your per visit? With this app, you can track how many times you use a product or a service and see the per use cost. The more you use something, the cheaper it gets!</p>

<p>Technologies used in this app include <strike>React, Apollo, GraphQL, and MongoDB </strike> MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN)</p>

<p>UPDATE (Sunday, 17 October 2019) After achieving basic functionality with the app (CRUD function, user authentication), I tried deploying my app to Heroku but failed miserably.  I'm now rewriting the App with a RESTful api as I have been able to successfully deploy RESTful apps in the past.  Hopefully deploying an app with graphql will become clearer in the future.
