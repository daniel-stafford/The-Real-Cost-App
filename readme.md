<p>Ever wonder how much something really costs? The Real Cost App is here to help. Say you buy a gym membership for the year - how much it is costing your per visit? With this app, you can track how many times you use a product or a service and see the per use cost. The more you use something, the cheaper it gets!</p>

<p>Technologies used in this app include React, Apollo, GraphQL, and MongoDB.</p>
